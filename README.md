## Introduction

*bradamsa-ng* is a [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/) extension that brings the power of the amazing 
[Radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa) fuzzer to Intruder. It is heavily influenced by the original 
[*bradamsa* by *ikkisoft*](https://github.com/ikkisoft/bradamsa) and aims to fix some of its weaknesses while building 
upon its strengths.

One noteworthy feature of *bradamsa-ng* is its support for [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).  
Radamsa is (understandably) not developed with Windows in mind, which means that there is no official support for it. 
There was a solution to [build Radamsa using Cygwin](https://github.com/aoh/radamsa/issues/31#issuecomment-266049451), 
but it didn't reliably work for me - and there's simply no guarantee that it'll work forever.  
  
With WSL however, we can compile and run Radamsa in its natural habitat - hell, we can even run it from the Windows host:

```shell script
PS> echo "fuzzing with radamsa is fun!" | wsl -d Ubuntu -e radamsa
fuzzzing with rrrrrradamsa is funn!
```

With *bradamsa-ng*, these new possibilities can now be leveraged in Burp.

## Requirements

* Java >= 8 ([Burp >= 2.0.14 ships with OpenJDK 11](https://twitter.com/Burp_Suite/status/1088829534600921090))
* Burp Suite >= 2.1

## Installation

* [Build](#building) the extension or download a [release](https://github.com/nscuro/bradamsa-ng/releases)
* Open Burp and navigate to the *Extender* tab
* Click *Add*
* In the dialog that just opened, select the extension type *Java*
* Click *Find File* and select your `bradamsa-ng-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
* Click *Next* - that's it

*bradamsa-ng* tries to automatically detect a *Radamsa* binary in your `$PATH`. If this succeeds, you'll
see a message saying 

> Radamsa binary was found at /some/path/radamsa 

in the extension's *Output* tab.

Likewise, when running on Windows and WSL is available, you'll either see

>WSL is available, but no installed distributions have been found

or 

> WSL is available and the following distributions have been found: [Ubuntu, Kali]

depending on if WSL distributions are installed or not.

## Building

* Linux / macOS: `./mvnw clean package`
* Windows: `mvnw.cmd clean package`

The installable extension JAR can now be found at `target/bradamsa-ng-${version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## Usage

### Intruder Payload Generator

* In Intruder's *Payloads* tab, select the payload type *Extension-generated*:
  ![Payload Type](.github/payload-generator_payload-type.png)
* Next, choose *bradamsa-ng* as generator under *Payload Options*:
  ![Payload Generator](.github/payload-generator_generator-extension.png)
* Set the amount of payloads you want to generate in the *bradamsa-ng* tab under *Payload Count*
  * **All** payloads will be generated before the first request is sent
* Start the Intruder attack
  * Please note that the *Battering Ram* attack is not supported

### Intruder Payload Processor

Not implemented yet.

### WSL mode

*bradamsa-ng* supports using Radamsa through Windows 10's *Windows Subsystem for Linux*.  
In order to take advantage of it, you need the following:

* Windows 10 with WSL installed
  * Instructions to install WSL can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* At least one installed WSL distribution (e.g. [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6))
* [Radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa) installed in at least one of the distributions
  * Using `sudo make install` will make it easier for *bradamsa-ng* to find the Radamsa binary

![Usage in WSL mode](.github/config-wsl.gif)

* The extension will let you know if WSL is available on startup as mentioned in [Installation](#installation)
* Switch to the *bradamsa-ng* tab and tick the *Enable WSL mode* checkbox
* Select the distribution where *Radamsa* is installed in
* *bradamsa-ng* will attempt to automatically find a Radamsa binary in the selected distro's `$PATH`
  * If this fails you can manually enter the **absolute** path to the binary **inside the WSL distro**
  * At this point, *bradamsa-ng* will simply check if the entered value points to an existing file **or** is a command that can be found in the distro's `$PATH`

#### Utilized commands

If - for whatever reason - your AV kicks in when using *bradamsa-ng* in WSL mode, here's a list of commands that get 
executed in order to make WSL mode possible:

* `where.exe`: Check if WSL is installed (`where.exe /q wsl.exe`)
* `WMIC.exe`: Determine Windows 10 Build Number (`WMIC.exe os get version /format:LIST`)
* `wslconfig.exe`: List available WSL distros (`wslconfig.exe /list`)
* `wsl.exe`: List available WSL distros; Execute commands in WSL (`wsl.exe --list`, `wsl.exe -d <DISTRO> -e <COMMAND>`)

## FAQ

### Why can't I choose a custom seed?

Quoting [Radamsa's README](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa#fuzzing-with-radamsa):

> By default radamsa will grab a random seed from /dev/urandom if it is not given a specific random state to start from, 
> and you will generally see a different result every time it is started, though for small inputs you might see the same 
> or the original fairly often. The random state to use can be given with the -s parameter, which is followed by a number. 
> **Using the same random state will result in the same data being generated**.

*bradamsa-ng*'s payload generator works by invoking Radamsa every time a new payload is requested by Intruder. 
Providing a custom seed would mean that the same payload will be generated over and over again, which would totally 
defeat the purpose of a fuzzer.

### I get an error saying "No base value or sample paths provided" for Battering Ram attacks. What am I doing wrong?

In Intruder, you specify the positions in a request to insert your payloads in. Typically, you'll just wrap the current
parameter's value inside two `ยง` symbols. When you run the attack, Burp will pass the current value to Payload Generators
and Payload Processors for modification. In this case, *bradamsa-ng* simply pipes the current value into Radamsa and returns
the result. The Battering Ram attack is different in that Burp won't pass any current values to payload generators or processors.
When using this attack mode, you'll have to specify at least one sample file, otherwise there simply isn't anything to fuzz.
